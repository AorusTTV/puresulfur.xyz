# Deployment Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for pre-launch security verification and post-launch monitoring.

## Pre-Launch Security Verification

### Node.js and Runtime Environment

  ```bash
  docker exec -it app-container node --version
  # Should output: v22.16.x or higher
  ```

- [ ] **Security dependencies up to date**
  ```bash
  npm audit --audit-level high
  npm run security:scan
  ```

- [ ] **Environment variables properly configured**
  - Database connection strings
  - API keys and secrets
  - Encryption keys
  - CORS origins

### Network and Infrastructure Security

- [ ] **Cloudflare WAF active with gambling ruleset**
  - Verify in Cloudflare dashboard: Security > WAF > Managed Rules
  - Test with `curl -H "User-Agent: sqlmap" https://yourdomain.com`

- [ ] **SSL/TLS configuration verified**
  - SSL Labs test score A+ or A
  - HSTS headers enabled
  - Certificate validity > 30 days

- [ ] **Rate limiting configured**
  - API endpoints: 100 requests/minute per IP
  - Authentication: 5 attempts/minute per IP
  - Game actions: Appropriate limits per game type

### Database and Data Protection

  - Backup files properly encrypted
  - Transit encryption for all connections

### CI/CD and Dependencies

- [ ] **Dependabot and Snyk configured**
  - Check GitHub Security tab for active alerts
  - Verify CI pipeline fails on HIGH/CRITICAL CVEs

- [ ] **Security scanning active**
  - Static code analysis passing
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning
  - Container image scanning

### Monitoring and Alerting

- [ ] **Monitoring alerts functional**
  - Trigger test alert: `curl -X POST localhost:3000/test-alert`
  - Verify Grafana dashboard displays metrics
  - Confirm alert notifications sent to security team

- [ ] **Log aggregation working**
  - Security events properly logged
  - Log retention policies applied
  - Centralized logging accessible

### Compliance and Legal

- [ ] **Compliance controls active**
  - Test age verification modal appears for new users
  - Verify KYC workflow triggers for large transactions
  - Confirm geo-blocking works for restricted regions

- [ ] **Privacy controls implemented**
  - GDPR compliance measures
  - Data retention policies
  - User data deletion capabilities

## Launch Day Procedures

### Final Security Checks

1. **Infrastructure Status**
   ```bash
   # Check all services are running
   systemctl status nginx
   systemctl status postgresql
   docker ps
   ```

2. **Security Monitoring**
   ```bash
   # Verify monitoring is active
   curl -s http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=up
   ```

3. **Backup Verification**
   ```bash
   # Confirm backups are running
   aws s3 ls s3://backup-bucket/database-backups/ | tail -5
   ```

### Go-Live Activities

- [ ] Enable production monitoring
- [ ] Activate all security alerts
- [ ] Begin security event logging
- [ ] Start automated backup schedule
- [ ] Enable real-time threat detection

## Post-Launch Monitoring

### First 24 Hours

- [ ] **Monitor authentication failures**
- [ ] **Check for DDoS attack patterns**
- [ ] **Verify backup completion**
- [ ] **Review security event logs**
- [ ] **Confirm monitoring alerts working**

### First Week

- [ ] **Review security metrics daily**
- [ ] **Analyze user behavior patterns**
- [ ] **Check for vulnerability discoveries**
- [ ] **Verify compliance controls**
- [ ] **Test incident response procedures**

### Ongoing Security Operations

- [ ] **Weekly security reviews**
- [ ] **Monthly vulnerability assessments**
- [ ] **Quarterly penetration testing**
- [ ] **Annual security audits**
- [ ] **Continuous compliance monitoring**

## Security Metrics to Monitor

### Critical Security Indicators

- Authentication failure rate < 1%
- Account lockout incidents < 10/day
- Failed payment attempts < 5%
- Suspicious user behavior alerts
- Geographic access anomalies

### Performance Security Metrics

- Average response time < 2 seconds
- API rate limit violations < 1%
- Database connection failures < 0.1%
- SSL certificate expiry warnings
- Security patch deployment time

## Emergency Response

### Incident Severity Classification

1. **P1 - Critical**: Active security breach, data theft, system compromise
2. **P2 - High**: Failed security controls, potential vulnerability exploitation
3. **P3 - Medium**: Security policy violations, minor configuration issues
4. **P4 - Low**: Security awareness issues, documentation updates

### Incident Response Contacts

- **Security Team**: security@rustskins.com
- **DevOps On-Call**: +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX  
- **Management Escalation**: +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX
- **Legal Counsel**: legal@rustskins.com

## Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback Checklist

- [ ] Identify problematic deployment
- [ ] Verify rollback target version
- [ ] Execute database migration rollback (if needed)
- [ ] Deploy previous application version
-[ ] Verify system functionality
- [ ] Update monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Document incident and resolution
