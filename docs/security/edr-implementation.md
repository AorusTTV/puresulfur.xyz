# EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) Implementation

## Overview

The EDR system provides real-time threat detection, behavioral analysis, and automated response capabilities for the Rust-Skins gambling platform. This implementation adds a comprehensive security monitoring layer that complements existing security controls.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Real-time Threat Detection
- **Network Monitoring**: Detects rapid requests and potential DDoS patterns
- **DOM Manipulation Detection**: Monitors for script injection attempts
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Identifies bot-like behavior and automated tools
- **Authentication Monitoring**: Tracks failed login attempts and suspicious access patterns

### ✅ Automated Response System
- **Input Sanitization**: Automatically blocks and sanitizes injection attempts
- **Rate Limiting**: Applies rate limits to users exhibiting suspicious behavior
- **Access Control**: Forces re-authentication for unauthorized access attempts
- **Request Blocking**: Blocks requests suspected of data exfiltration

### ✅ Advanced Behavioral Analysis
- **Mouse Movement Tracking**: Detects non-human interaction patterns
- **Keystroke Analysis**: Identifies rapid automated typing
- **Click Pattern Detection**: Monitors for automated clicking behaviors
- **Browser Environment Analysis**: Detects headless browsers and automation tools

### ✅ Threat Classification System
- **Severity Levels**: Low, Medium, High, Critical
- **Threat Types**: 
  - Malware detection
  - Suspicious behavior
  - Unauthorized access attempts
  - Data exfiltration attempts
  - Script injection attempts

### ✅ Administrative Dashboard
- **Real-time Metrics**: Live threat counts and statistics
- **Threat Analytics**: Detailed analysis of attack patterns
- **Filtering System**: Filter threats by type and severity
- **Historical Data**: 24-hour threat timeline

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **EDRProvider** (`src/components/security/EDRProvider.tsx`)
   - Main context provider for EDR functionality
   - Manages threat detection and automated responses
   - Maintains threat metrics and active threat list

2. **ThreatDetector** (`src/components/security/ThreatDetector.tsx`)
   - Visual monitoring component for end users
   - Real-time status display
   - Initial security scanning on page load

3. **AdminThreatDashboard** (`src/components/security/AdminThreatDashboard.tsx`)
   - Comprehensive admin interface for threat management
   - Analytics and reporting capabilities
   - Threat filtering and detailed analysis

### Detection Patterns

```typescript
const suspiciousPatterns = {
  rapidRequests: { threshold: 50, window: 60000 },     // 50 requests/minute
  failedLogins: { threshold: 5, window: 300000 },     // 5 failures/5 minutes
  unusualNavigation: { threshold: 100, window: 60000 }, // 100 nav changes/minute
  suspiciousScripts: [
    /eval\s*\(/gi,
    /document\.write\s*\(/gi,
    /innerHTML\s*=/gi,
    // ... additional patterns
  ]
};
```

### Automated Response Actions

| Threat Type | Automated Response |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Script Injection | `INPUT_SANITIZED_AND_BLOCKED` |
| Suspicious Behavior (Critical) | `RATE_LIMITED_USER` |
| Unauthorized Access | `FORCED_REAUTHENTICATION` |
| Data Exfiltration | `REQUEST_BLOCKED_ADMIN_ALERTED` |
| General Threats | `LOGGED_FOR_ANALYSIS` |

## Integration Points

### With Existing Security Stack
- **Security Monitor**: Integrates with existing security event logging
- **Auth Context**: Monitors authentication events and user behavior
- **CSRF Protection**: Works alongside CSRF validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Enhances existing rate limiting controls

### Global Event Handlers
```typescript
// Available globally for integration
window.logSecurityEvent     // Security event logging
window.reportAuthFailure    // Authentication failure reporting
```

## Monitoring Capabilities

### Real-time Detection
- Network request patterns
- DOM manipulation attempts
- User interaction analysis
- Browser environment fingerprinting
- Extension and tool detection

### Metrics Tracked
- Total threats detected
- Threats automatically blocked
- Active threats (24-hour window)
- Suspicious activities count
- Last scan timestamp

### Administrative Features
- Live threat dashboard
- Threat filtering by severity/type
- Historical threat analysis
- Attack pattern identification
- Automated response tracking

## Configuration

### Detection Thresholds
All detection thresholds are configurable via the `suspiciousPatterns` object:
- Adjust sensitivity based on legitimate user behavior
- Customize response actions for different threat types
- Modify time windows for pattern detection

### Response Actions
Automated responses can be customized in `handleAutomatedResponse()`:
- Add new response types
- Modify existing response logic
- Integrate with external security tools

## Security Benefits

1. **Proactive Threat Detection**: Identifies threats before they cause damage
2. **Automated Mitigation**: Reduces manual intervention required for common threats
3. **Behavioral Analysis**: Detects sophisticated attacks that bypass traditional controls
4. **Real-time Visibility**: Provides immediate insight into security posture
5. **Compliance Support**: Generates audit trails for security events

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal Overhead**: Lightweight event listeners and efficient pattern matching
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking threat analysis
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of old threat data (7-day retention)
- **Optimized Updates**: Batched updates every 30 seconds for UI components

## Deployment Status

✅ **Fully Implemented**: All EDR components are production-ready
✅ **Admin Integration**: Security dashboard accessible via admin panel
✅ **Real-time Monitoring**: Active threat detection and response
✅ **Documentation**: Complete implementation documentation

The EDR system is now active and providing continuous security monitoring for the Rust-Skins platform.
